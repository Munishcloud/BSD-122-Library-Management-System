# BSD 122 - Online Library Management System

## Problem Overview
The aim of this assignment is to design and implement a simple Online Library Management System using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles in C++. The system manages books in a library and allows users to perform basic operations such as adding books, displaying available books, borrowing books, and returning books.

## OOP Concepts Used
* **Classes and Objects** – Used to model entities like books and the library
* **Encapsulation** – Data and related functions are combined into classes
* **Abstraction** – Hiding implementation details while exposing essential features

## System Design
The system consists of two main classes:
1. **Book Class**: Represents an individual book with attributes like ID, Title, Author, and Status.
2. **Library Class**: Manages the collection of books and handles all interactions.

## Features
* Add new books
* Display available books
* Borrow books
* Return books

## How to run 
Run the program:
./library
Example Usage

1. Display all books

5. Exit
Enter your choice: 1
Notes
The system uses simple console input/output.
Book status is tracked to prevent borrowing unavailable books.
Designed using OOP principles for clarity and modularity.
